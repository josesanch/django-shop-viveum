====================
django-shop-viveum
====================

This module is a payment backend module for django-SHOP, using Viveum 
(https://viveum.v-psp.com) as the shops payment service provider. It can be
used for credit card and other kind of payments.

Currently only payment methods are implemented, which do not require a PCI DSS
certification (https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) for your shop.
This means that your shop never "sees" the credit card numbers.
With this module your customer "leaves" your shop to enter his credit card numbers
on the Viveum site secured by SSL. Afterwards the customer is redirected back to
the shop using a special URL, which transports the payment confirmation using a
signature technique.

Installation
============
Using pip::

    pip install django-shop-viveum

Shop Configuration
==================

In settings.py

* Add â€˜viveum', to INSTALLED_APPS.
* Add 'synthesa.payment.backends.ViveumPaymentBackend' to SHOP_PAYMENT_BACKENDS.
* Add the configuration dictionary::

    VIVEUM_PAYMENT = {
        'ORDER_STANDARD_URL': 'https://viveum.v-psp.com/ncol/%s/orderstandard_UTF8.asp' % ('prod' if not DEBUG else 'test'),
        'PSPID': 'your_PSPID',  # the same you use to log into https://viveum.v-psp.com/ncol/test/admin_viveum.asp
        'ORDER_DESCRIPTION': 'Your order (%s) at Awesome Shop',
        'SHA1_IN_SIGNATURE': 'some_hash_value',
        'SHA1_OUT_SIGNATURE': 'some_hash_value',
        'CURRENCY': 'EUR',
        'LANGUAGE': 'en_EN', # 
        'TITLE': 'Greeting at Viveum during payment',
    }


Test the Configuration
======================

In order to run the unit tests, you must install an additional Python package,
which is not required for normal operation::

    pip install httplib2==0.7.6

Unfortunately there is a still unresolved issue with SSL on httplib2. Therefore you
must make some modifications on httplib2. Install version 0.7.6, change into your
Python site-packages directory and apply the following patch file as found in docs::

    patch -p0 < docs/httplib2-0.7.6-ssl.patch

Change the values for VIVEUM_PAYMENT in ``tests/testapp/settings.py`` according 
to the chosen configuration. The run ``./runtests.sh``. If everything worked fine,
you should receive two emails, one for a successful, and one for a declined payment.
If there is an error, check the error log at the Viveum admin interface.
